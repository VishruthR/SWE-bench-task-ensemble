# Google Jules + Gemini 2.0 Flash (v20241212-experimental)
Jules is an AI-powered code agent that can help developers in the background so they can focus on critical tasks. Working asynchronously and integrated with your GitHub workflow, Jules handles bug fixes and other time-consuming tasks while you focus on what you actually want to build. Jules creates comprehensive, multi-step plans to address issues, efficiently modifies multiple files, and even prepares pull requests to land fixes directly back into GitHub.

Our team has evaluated an experimental version of Jules based on Gemini 2.0 Flash on the SWE-bench Verified dataset. The agent relies on Gemini's code understanding and editing capabilities, further equipped with code execution tools. It proposes and evaluates hundreds of potential solutions, selecting the best from Gemini's own judgments and existing unit tests. See [trajs/README.md](trajs/README.md) for details.
