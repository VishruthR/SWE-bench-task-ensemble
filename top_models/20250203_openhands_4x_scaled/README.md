An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents</h1>

OpenHands (f.k.a. OpenDevin) is a platform for the development of powerful and flexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human developer: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the web.

# Details

This submission is made using both `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (sampling with temperature for 3 runs) and `o3-mini-2025-01-31`. We use a fine-tuned verifier (reward model) to re-rank solutions similar to [SWE-Gym](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21139).

# Checklist

- [X] Is a pass@1 submission (does not attempt the same task instance more than once)
- [X] Does not use SWE-bench test knowledge (`PASS_TO_PASS`, `FAIL_TO_PASS`)
- [X] Does not use the `hints` field in SWE-bench
- [X] Does not have web-browsing OR has taken steps to prevent lookup of SWE-bench solutions via web-browsing
